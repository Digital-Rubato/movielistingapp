# movielistingapp

A movie listing app created with help from traversy media. https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb . 

This project was a good introduction into API's and jQuery. The Api integration was way easier than i thought it was going to be, I had assumed that it would be a lot of call backs to the server. Back and forth, such as calling for an image of the object, the title, etc. On top of the small intro into jQuery. I had often wondered how to make sure one language interfaced with another. I theorized, in my limited knowledge, that it would be a series of print statements. I am glad that this was the case, but i would like to know how more advanced languages interface with lower level ones. like c++ to html or javascript.

Other wise it was a good project to learn from, from auto creating style sheet design to jQuery and Api's.
